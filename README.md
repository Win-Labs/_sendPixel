## 📝 Project Overview

_sendPixel is a **unique blockchain-based game** that seamlessly blends **creativity, competition, and crowdfunding**. 🌟 The challenge of storing pixel data on-chain can be costly, but _sendPixel introduces an innovative approach to solve this. Instead of directly storing pixel data, each pixel's **RGB color values and its coordinates (x, y)** are encoded into the **amount of native ETH** sent to the contract. This design leverages the blockchain's most cost-efficient function: **transferring coins**. 🎨💡

The structure is simple yet powerful — pixel data is represented in transactions as `0.0......0rgbxy`. A backend service then listens for on-chain events, decodes this data back into color and coordinates, and renders it on the frontend canvas. This transforms the experience into a **gamified canvas coloring game**, where participants can color pixels by sending ETH to a designated **Canvas contract address**.

Each canvas holds the ETH contributed by players, and the creator of the canvas can set a custom recipient to claim the accumulated funds. This means the project not only fuels collaborative art but also serves as a **gamified form of crowdfunding**, with creators benefiting from user contributions.

To maximize inclusivity and engagement, _sendPixel is deployed across multiple blockchain networks, allowing users to select their preferred chain. This deployment encourages **healthy competition** among various Layer 2 solutions, contributing to a dynamic and diverse ecosystem. 🌐🚀

## ⚙️ Local Setup

### 1. **Set up the Frontend (Client)**

To run the frontend (website):

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/.git](https://github.com/mahammadZeynalov/_sendPixel.git)
   cd _sendPixel
   ```

2. **Navigate to the client directory**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The website should now be running locally at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 2. **Set up the Backend (Server)**

To run the backend (database):

1. **Navigate to the server directory**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The backend should now be running, and your database will be ready for use.
